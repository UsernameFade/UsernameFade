- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UsernameFade
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in artificial life, namely creating simulations of evolution in an effort to develop models of lifeforms, and solve math problems without doing much math. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code. No idea what that means though. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Whatever means you find to reach me, just use those. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't really know what I'm doing (yet!)
